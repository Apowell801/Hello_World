# Hello_World
First repository - Basics

Greetings,

I have no clue what I am doing. I am a newbie to coding and to Github. I have been working in ArcGIS and a background in remote sensing, but have found all things in life want and need coding. So I'm here to learn and hopefully open up more opportunities for myself.

Cheers
